# Introduction

This is an extension which adds an alerting feature to the open source [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/) project management web application.

## User guide

- Configure the extension: add a domain name and select the desired ways of getting notified, as well as an alert checking interval.
- Then, navigate to a Redmine task, select the field and it's desired value, and click to add an alert.
- The extension will then run in the background and continue checking for any triggered alerts. 

Note: Alerts will also sync between devices that use the same Chrome Google account.
